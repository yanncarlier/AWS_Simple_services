# Here is an example of how you can use Terraform to create random Kubernetes secrets:



locals {
  secret_data = {
    password = random_string.secret.result
  }
}

resource "random_string" "secret" {
  length = 16
}

resource "kubernetes_secret" "example" {
  metadata {
    name      = "example-secret"
    namespace = "default"
  }

  data = {
    password = local.secret_data.password
  }
}



# This code creates a random_string resource that generates a random string of length 16, which will be used as the password for the secret.
# Then it creates a kubernetes_secret resource, which creates a secret in the default namespace with the name "example-secret", and the password is set to the generated random string.

# Please note that this code is just an example, and you should adjust the name, namespace and secret data according to your specific requirements.

# Additionally, it is recommended to store secrets in a secure secret manager and retrieve them at runtime, rather than hardcoding them in Terraform scripts.

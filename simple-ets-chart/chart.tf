# terraform code to install a helm chart

# Here is an example of how you can use Terraform to install a Helm chart:




resource "helm_release" "example" {
  name       = "example"
  repository = "https://example.com/charts"
  chart      = "example-chart"
  version    = "1.0.0"
  namespace  = "default"

  values = {
    image = {
      repository = "example-repo",
      tag       = "latest"
    }
  }
}



# This code creates a helm_release resource, which installs a 
# Helm chart from a specified repository, with a given name, 
# version, namespace, and values for the chart's configuration.
# It sets the chart name as "example-chart" and version "1.0.0" 
# from the repository "https://example.com/charts" and sets the 
# namespace as "default", and also sets the values of the image 
# repository and tag.

# Please note that this code is just an example, and you should 
# adjust the repository, chart name, version, namespace and 
# values according to your specific requirements.
# Also, you need to have helm installed on the machine where 
# you are going to run this script.

# Additionally, it's a good practice to use helm_module 
# resource to manage your helm charts instead of the helm_release 
# resource.

# Please be aware that you should be aware of the cost of 
# using the service from where you are downloading the charts 
# from.

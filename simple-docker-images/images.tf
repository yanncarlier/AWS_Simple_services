# terraform code to pull docker images from gitlab



# Here is an example of how you can use Terraform to 
# pull Docker images from a GitLab repository:


resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "docker login -u ${var.gitlab_username} -p ${var.gitlab_password} ${var.gitlab_registry}"
  }
}

resource "docker_image" "example" {
  name = "${var.gitlab_registry}/${var.gitlab_group}/${var.image_name}:${var.image_tag}"
}





# This code creates a null resource that uses the local-exec 
# provisioner to run a docker login command with the provided 
# GitLab username, password and registry. Then, it creates 
# a docker_image resource that pulls the specified image from 
# the GitLab registry, using the name attribute to specify the 
# full image name, including the registry, group and image 
# name and tag.

# You can use variables to pass the GitLab username, password, 
# registry, group, image name and image tag to the Terraform 
# code.
# You should also be aware that this code is just an example 
# and you should use GitLab's official Terraform provider 
# to manage your GitLab resources, as well as using more 
# secure method to manage your secrets like using Hashicorp Vault 
# or AWS Secrets Manager.

# Please be aware that to use this code you need to have docker 
# installed on the machine where you are going to run this 
# script.
# Also, you should be aware of the cost of using GitLab services.
